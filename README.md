# Final-Project
### MY Project
e-Commerce is an open-source software made to create an easy and simple "Shop", where you have two micro services, one the Products that stores and handles everything Related to Stock and Products. And the Purchase where you can create orders (cart's) and checkout items.
***
My idea with this website is to develop an e-commerce website that can be easily customized and added to the cart by the user. The site has all the features that you would expect from an e-commerce website including product pages, product view pages, a shopping cart and checkout.
***
My project is a simple ecommerce Natural Green Products selling website which allows users to login, signup and also it allows user to add products to the cart and checkout. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart. User can check out product. User can click forgot password and can create new one if in case he/she forgot the password, by giving and verifying user email id associated to account. User can login to account by giving user mail id and password.
